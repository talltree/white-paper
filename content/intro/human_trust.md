Trust is defined as to have confidence, faith or hope in a relationship with someone or something.

Trust is both an emotional and logical act. Emotionally, it is where you expose your vulnerabilities to people, but believing they will not take advantage of your openness. Effectively, trust is a feeling. Emotions associated with trust include companionship, friendship, love, agreement, relaxation, comfort.

When considering collaborative relationships, the four most common elements needed to develop trust are:

* competence
* reliability
* integrity
* communication

Without any one of these, it can be difficult to create the trust needed for a sustainable and successful interactions between the parties of a relationship.

Examples of In-Person or "Human Trust" include:

* believing that the sun will rise in the morning
* confidence that the school bus driver will safely transport your child to school
* comfort in the experience and capabilities of your doctor
* relying on the bank to carry-out your financial transactions
* respecting your employers ability and policies to protect your personal data

The complexities of our daily lifestyles have moved beyond In-Person Trust to include the challenges of online interactions. Yet the same elements of trust must be considered regardless of the mode of interaction (physical, online).
